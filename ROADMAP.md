# Enodia: Roadmap

**The single status view.** What is done, what is next, what is blocked. Detail lives
elsewhere and is linked, never duplicated: this file says *where things stand*, the others
say *what the thing is*.

Last updated 27 August 2026, game build `138174`.

---

## Where the build is

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phase** | 1, "The Exit" |
| **Build order step** | 8 of 11 complete, step 9 next. **Step 8 was the first shippable point and it is done** |
| **Shippable at** | Step 8, the timeline shell. Useful to a player with no rating engine at all |
| **Stack** | Vite 8, React 19, TypeScript 7, Vitest 4. Scaffolded and building |

**The tool works.** Set up a run, log what each Exit gave, and the timeline records what
each pick closed at the pick that closed it. Settling the fourth Olympian reads "35 builds
closed here" against that entry, and the present entry says what is still live and which god
feeds it. That is the originating complaint answered, and it is the first shippable point.

Not shipped yet: the hand-authored page is still `placeholder/index.html` and still what
Netlify serves. Deploying the app is a decision, not a task.

## Phase 1 build order

The sequence is fixed in `DESIGN.md` 10. Status only here.

| Step | What | State |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Extractor, Lua to `data/generated` | **Done.** 57 files, zero failures. Text and stacking curves included |
| 2 | Validator wired into prebuild | **Done.** 8 checks, 38 unit tests. `npm run build` stops on a broken reference |
| 3 | Asset join, every trait has an icon or a recorded gap | **Done.** 310 of 310 offerable traits and 24 of 24 aspects have art, zero gaps |
| 4 | `engine/slots.ts` and the type layer | **Done.** Inheritance resolved, the lockout encoded, 22 tests |
| 5 | `engine/reachability.ts` | **Done.** Four states, bands, god priority. 114 tests, and it runs against the real 47 targets |
| 6 | `engine/runsim.ts` | **Done.** Seeded, legal runs. The dead-stays-dead property holds over 25 of them |
| 7 | Setup screen, and the rail | **Done.** Weapon, aspect and Exits in, a real RunContext out, and the rail fills as you log |
| 8 | **The timeline shell.** First shippable point | **Done.** Deaths recorded at the pick that caused them, verdicts in the present entry |
| 9 | Verdict snapshotting, `engine/briefing.ts`, re-entry header | Next |
| 10 | `engine/rules.ts`, one rule, then `scripts/health.ts` | |
| 11 | The offer block inside the present entry | |

Later phases are scoped in `REQUIREMENTS.md` 7: **2** before the run, **3** memory,
**4** automation and community.

## Blocked, and on whom

| What | On | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Netlify redeploy | The owner | The live page is several revisions behind, and its publish directory is now `placeholder/` rather than `dist/` |
| Two "rooms" on the live page | The owner | The validator reports them. `placeholder/index.html` lines 1106 and 1362 say "ten rooms in" and "encounter rooms". Copy is the owner's to change |
| `feeds` tag | The owner | `DESIGN.md` 12 item 8. Largest hand-authoring job in the project, and the briefing's advice line needs it |
| Archetype `core` / `compatible` / `avoid` lists | The owner | `DESIGN.md` 4.1.4. Not derivable from any file |

---

## Carried over, not done

These are real and none of them block step 2.

**Data**

- ~~Inheritance is not resolved in the extractor~~. **Done.** The extractor runs the game's
  own `ProcessDataInheritance` and writes `traits-resolved.json`. 49 traits state a `Slot`,
  122 carry one afterwards. The validator still walks `InheritFrom` itself for
  classification and `GodLoot`, which is now a redundant second implementation and should
  read the resolved file instead
- `traits.json` is eight entity types in one file. The game tags every one via
  `InheritFrom`, so splitting is mechanical
- 84 of 651 traits have no display name. Believed to be base templates, unverified
- ~~The extractor finds 33 duos. Wikis claim 29 and 37~~. **Answered:** 37 duos, 10
  legendaries, 9 Hex duos, classified by the game's own markers rather than by counting
  prerequisite sets. See `CLAUDE.md`

**Assets**

- ~~144 of 579 trait icons unmatched~~. **Closed for the set that matters:** 306 of the
  310 traits a run can offer have art. The remaining 4 are Daedalus Hammer upgrades that
  are in neither the game package nor the wiki scrape, and they are recorded in
  `data/curated/icons.json` so the build stays honest about them
- ~~Aspect numbering in `assets/aspects/` unverified~~. **Resolved by matching pictures,
  not by assuming.** 24 game icons plus 23 wiki renders, all named by aspect. The Black
  Coat's base render is unusable and is the one real gap left
- Missing: familiars and status effect icons. Tartarus came out of the run history icons,
  and the 4 hammer icons turned out to be present all along
- The Black Coat has no good base render in any source, and five framings were rejected.
  The owner will hunt for one personally. The game's aspect icon carries it until then
- 17 wiki images lost their manifest row when someone moved them between categories.
  `npm run assets` names them
- `placeholder/index.html` inlines its own token copy. `src/ui/tokens.css` is the source,
  and the app now imports it directly

**The open product question, 28 August 2026**

> "A single duo or legendary is not a build. Builds are more intricate, and are often
> centered around a combination of a Daedalus Hammer, a duo, a legendary and a specific
> aspect. Tracking a single duo gives no more of an edge than tracking it in game."

That is right and it changes what the tool tracks. The engine does not need changing: a
build is the same set-cover problem with more sets in it, and `reachable` already takes
targets as an argument. What is missing is the **definitions**, which are judgement and
therefore the owner's, per `CLAUDE.md`. Proposed shape in `data/curated/builds.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "zeus-apollo-double-legendary",
  "name": "Glorious Disaster, both legendaries",
  "say": "what this build does and how it plays, one paragraph",
  "requires": [["ApolloCastBoon"], ["ZeusCastBoon"], ["SpawnKillBoon"]],
  "aspect": "StaffCirceAspect",
  "hammers": ["StaffPowershotTrait"],
  "gods": { "core": ["Zeus", "Apollo"], "compatible": ["Poseidon"], "avoid": ["Hestia"] }
}
```

The 47 duos and legendaries stay as the fallback for a run with no build chosen, since
something has to be tracked before a build is picked.

**The mechanism is built and empty.** `engine/reachability.ts verdictForBuild` judges a
build through the same set-cover code as a duo, counting the aspect and each hammer as
their own set, so an aspect chosen at setup can settle a build before the first Exit.
`data/curated/builds.json` carries the shape and no records. Write one and it works.

**From the owner, 28 August 2026**

- ~~Setup asked how many Exits a run has~~. A player does not know, so it is an estimate
  now, corrected from the run header
- ~~The Exit picker only offered gods~~. It offers what an Exit actually gives, and the
  Encounter gods besides
- ~~A radial weapon picker using the large Codex art, the chosen weapon animating to the
  centre with its four aspects around it~~. Done, and the same ring is now the whole
  picker
- ~~The rail as a permanent sidebar~~. Done, and the timeline is the only thing that
  scrolls now. It unfolds to everything held, by slot, with the game's own sentence on each,
  and every slot has a tooltip
- ~~Which regions each Encounter god appears in~~. **Sourced:** Artemis only in `RoomDataF`
  which is Erebus, Hades only in `RoomDataI` which is Tartarus, Dionysus only in
  `RoomDataP` which is Ephyra. Athena appears in no room data, which fits her arriving
  through her keepsake. The picker filters on it
- **In progress:** a look that is more Crossroads and less web app. The game's own boon
  plates and rarity frames are in `assets/frames/`, and `assets/chrome/` now carries
  `TraitTrayBacking` (the tone-on-tone ornament `VISUAL.md` 1 asks for by name), the tray
  header ribbon, the tooltip nine-slice and the hairline dividers
- ~~The timeline as a separate screen with the picker tacked on underneath~~. **The run is
  one path going down.** Each Exit is a station, centred and large, and the present station
  is the picker itself: kind, then who, then which one, each a ring, skipping any step with
  a single answer. Finishing a pick advances the run and carries the page to the next Exit.
  Going back in time is scrolling up. `Tray.tsx` and `LogPick.tsx` are gone
- ~~The gods as the game's `BoonSelectSymbols` glyphs~~. Reverted on sight. They are small
  glowing marks meant to be read on a door at a distance and they render as coloured dots
  in a list. Portraits, larger than before. `assets/symbols/` keeps the glyphs
- ~~The filigree circle around each bubble~~. Replaced by `frames/circle.png`, which is
  BoonSelect's carved ring. It is a closed circle, so neighbouring bubbles no longer put
  their flourishes on top of each other, and its hole is 77 percent of the image, which
  fixes the frame at 130 percent of a bubble. **A face fills the circle; nothing else
  does.** A boon mark, a slot glyph and a hammer are rounded squares and a weapon is a
  diagonal cutout, and a circular crop takes the corners off all of them, so they sit
  inside the ring instead
- **The menu exists as a shell.** One button top left, covering rather than pushing, with
  build manager, build exchange, account, friends, leaderboards, settings, help and about
  listed and marked unbuilt. Starting a run is always its first entry
- **Open:** which regions each Encounter god appears in. `RoomData` places Artemis in F,
  Dionysus in P and Hades in I, and says nothing about Athena, so the letter to region
  mapping has to be established before the path can filter anything
- **Open:** the owner reports the Fields offer three Encounters behind one Exit, and that
  the first surface Location is one open city with eight or nine ways out rather than two.
  Both are map generation rather than a table, and neither is modelled

**Engine**

- ~~A filled slot is not a proof of impossible~~. Handled: `obtainability` returns `swap`
  as its own route, and only a set with nothing but swaps left in it is called a long shot
- ~~How the app gets its data~~. `npm run data` projects `data/generated` through
  `src/data/load.ts` into `data/app/app-data.json`, 78 KB and 15 gzipped, imported rather
  than fetched. One mapping, shared by the app, the tests and the validator
- **`publicDir` is `assets/`,** so a manifest path is also a URL. About 33 MB ships, 23 of
  which is Arcana card art Phase 1 never renders. Downscale it before a real deploy.
  `frames/circle.png` is the first one done: 2.37 MB at 2475 square, 249 KB at 512, for a
  ring drawn at about 150 pixels across
- The Exit count in Setup defaults to 12 and is a placeholder. The real number wants region
  data, which is not extracted
- The verdicts are only as good as the targets. Every duo and legendary is a target today,
  which is 47. Archetypes, once the owner writes them, are what turn that into a shortlist

**Open questions**

`DESIGN.md` 12 holds ten. The ones that will bite first are the `feeds` tag, the
`minRuns` threshold for gap analysis, and whether the save file can seed the run tally.
